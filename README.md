## Notebooks Description

### Simple_Linear_Regression.ipynb

This notebook covers the basics of simple linear regression using TensorFlow. It demonstrates how to:
- Prepare and preprocess data for a simple linear regression model
- Build and train a TensorFlow model for simple linear regression
- Evaluate the model's performance
- Make predictions using the trained model

### Multi_Variable_Linear_Regression.ipynb

This notebook extends the concept to multiple variable (multivariate) linear regression. It includes:
- Handling datasets with multiple features
- Scaling and normalizing multi-dimensional data
- Implementing a TensorFlow model for multiple variable linear regression
- Training and evaluating the multivariate model
- Using the model for predictions with multiple input variables

### Stock_Price_Prediction_LSTM_CNN_Tensorflow.ipynb

This notebook demonstrates time series forecasting for stock price prediction using TensorFlow. It covers how to:
- Acquire and preprocess historical stock price data
- Build and train a hybrid CNN-LSTM model for sequence learning
- Evaluate the model's performance using loss and metrics
- Visualize actual vs. predicted stock prices over time

### Simple_RNN_Tensorflow.ipynb

- This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using TensorFlow for sequence prediction.
- The model is trained on a simple sequence of numbers and can predict the next number in the sequence.

### Sentiment Analysis Model.ipynb

This script implements a basic sentiment analysis model using TensorFlow and Keras. It demonstrates:
- Text tokenization and sequence preprocessing
- Building a neural network with an embedding layer
- Training a binary sentiment classification model
- Predicting sentiment for new text inputs
